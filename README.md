# Graph Library for C# (Directed and Undirected)

![Screenshot 2024-02-25 085346](https://github.com/avill2022/Grafo-Dinamico-Generico/assets/105819329/d91095ea-2e5b-44a3-a656-f3815446f9bd)

## Overview

This C# Graph Library is designed to provide functionality for creating and manipulating both directed and undirected graphs. Whether you're building algorithms, conducting research, or implementing graph-based applications, this library aims to provide a robust set of tools to support your needs.

## Features

- **Directed Graphs:** Create and manage directed graphs, where edges have a defined direction from one vertex to another.

- **Undirected Graphs:** Create and manage undirected graphs, where edges have no direction and simply represent connections between vertices.

- **Vertex and Edge Operations:** Perform operations such as adding vertices and edges, removing vertices and edges, and querying properties of vertices and edges.

- **Graph Traversal:** Implement algorithms for traversing graphs, including depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

- **Graph Algorithms:** Explore a range of graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm, and more.
